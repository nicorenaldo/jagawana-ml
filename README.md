# Jagawana - Machine Learning Notebook

This is a Machine Learning Notebook to classify natural sounds using Augmented-VGG16 Architecture part of the Jagawana Capstone Project.

---

Jagawana is a Forest Logging Prevention System, using Wide Sensor Network to detect and alert chainsaws sounds to users using Android App and Google Cloud Platform. The Machine Learning Model is developed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nicorenaldo/jagawana-forest-logging-detection/). 

We use the dataset ESC-50 to train our model, from [here](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mmoreaux/environmental-sound-classification-50)

## Getting Started

It's highly recommended to fork our notebook from our [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/nicorenaldo/jagawana-forest-logging-detection/).

You can start training your own model immediately by modifying the Model Section or load your own model.
